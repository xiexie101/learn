Over the last few months we have begun to see glimpses of our AI systems improving themselves. The improvement is slow for now, but undeniable. Developing superintelligence is now in sight.

在过去的几个月里，我们开始看到我们的 AI 系统进行自我提升的迹象。虽然目前进展缓慢，但趋势毋庸置疑。开发超级智能（superintelligence）已近在眼前。

It seems clear that in the coming years, AI will improve all our existing systems and enable the creation and discovery of new things that aren’t imaginable today. But it is an open question what we will direct superintelligence towards.

显而易见，在未来几年，AI 将会改进我们所有现有的系统，并促成今天无法想象的新事物的创造和发现。但我们将引导超级智能走向何方，这仍是一个悬而未决的问题。

In some ways this will be a new era for humanity, but in others it’s just a continuation of historical trends. As recently as 200 years ago, 90% of people were farmers growing food to survive. Advances in technology have steadily freed much of humanity to focus less on subsistence and more on the pursuits we choose. At each step, people have used our newfound productivity to achieve more than was previously possible, pushing the frontiers of science and health, as well as spending more time on creativity, culture, relationships, and enjoying life.

从某些方面说，这将是人类的一个新纪元，但从另一些方面看，这只是历史趋势的延续。就在 200 年前，90% 的人还是为了生存而种地的农民。技术的进步稳步地将大部分人从生存的重负中解放出来，让我们能更多地专注于自己选择的事业。每一步，人们都利用新获得的生产力去实现比以往更多的可能，推动科学和健康的边界，同时也花更多时间在创造、文化、人际关系和享受生活上。

I am extremely optimistic that superintelligence will help humanity accelerate our pace of progress. But perhaps even more important is that superintelligence has the potential to begin a new era of personal empowerment where people will have greater agency to improve the world in the directions they choose.

我非常乐观，相信超级智能将帮助人类加速进步的步伐。但也许更重要的是，超级智能有潜力开启一个个人赋能的新时代，人们将拥有更大的自主权，朝着他们自己选择的方向去改善世界。

As profound as the abundance produced by AI may one day be, an even more meaningful impact on our lives will likely come from everyone having a personal superintelligence that helps you achieve your goals, create what you want to see in the world, experience any adventure, be a better friend to those you care about, and grow to become the person you aspire to be.

AI 带来的富足有朝一日可能会非常深刻，但对我们生活意义更为深远的影响，可能来自于每个人都拥有一个个人超级智能，它能帮助你实现目标，创造你想看到的世界，体验任何冒险，成为你在乎的人的更好朋友，并成长为你渴望成为的人。

Meta’s vision is to bring personal superintelligence to everyone. We believe in putting this power in people’s hands to direct it towards what they value in their own lives.

Meta 的愿景是将个人超级智能带给每一个人。我们相信应该将这种力量交到人们手中，让他们引导它去实现自己生活中所珍视的价值。

This is distinct from others in the industry who believe superintelligence should be directed centrally towards automating all valuable work, and then humanity will live on a dole of its output. At Meta, we believe that people pursuing their individual aspirations is how we have always made progress expanding prosperity, science, health, and culture. This will be increasingly important in the future as well.

这与业内其他一些观点不同，他们认为超级智能应该由中心化机构主导，用于自动化所有有价值的工作，然后人类靠其产出的福利过活。在 Meta，我们相信，人们追求个人理想，一直是我们推动繁荣、科学、健康和文化进步的方式。这一点在未来也会愈发重要。

The intersection of technology and how people live is Meta’s focus, and this will only become more important in the future.

技术与人们生活方式的交汇点是 Meta 的焦点，这一点在未来只会变得更加重要。

If trends continue, then you’d expect people to spend less time in productivity software, and more time creating and connecting. Personal superintelligence that knows us deeply, understands our goals, and can help us achieve them will be by far the most useful. Personal devices like glasses that understand our context because they can see what we see, hear what we hear, and interact with us throughout the day will become our primary computing devices.

如果趋势延续，你可以预见人们会花更少时间在生产力软件上，而花更多时间去创造和连接。一个深度了解我们、理解我们目标并能帮助我们实现的个人超级智能，将是迄今为止最有用的工具。像眼镜这样的个人设备，因为能看到我们所见、听到我们所闻，并与我们全天互动，所以能理解我们的处境，它们将成为我们的主要计算设备。

We believe the benefits of superintelligence should be shared with the world as broadly as possible. That said, superintelligence will raise novel safety concerns. We’ll need to be rigorous about mitigating these risks and careful about what we choose to open source. Still, we believe that building a free society requires that we aim to empower people as much as possible.

我们相信，超级智能的益处应该尽可能广泛地与世界分享。话虽如此，超级智能也会带来新的安全问题。我们需要严格地去减轻这些风险，并对我们选择 open source 的内容保持谨慎。尽管如此，我们相信，建立一个自由的社会，要求我们尽可能地去赋能于人。

The rest of this decade seems likely to be the decisive period for determining the path this technology will take, and whether superintelligence will be a tool for personal empowerment or a force focused on replacing large swaths of society.

这个十年的剩余时间，很可能将是决定这项技术发展道路的关键时期，也将决定超级智能究竟是成为个人赋能的工具，还是一股专注于取代社会大部分岗位的力量。

Meta believes strongly in building personal superintelligence that empowers everyone. We have the resources and the expertise to build the massive infrastructure required, and the capability and will to deliver new technology to billions of people across our products. I’m excited to focus Meta’s efforts towards building this future.

Meta 坚信要构建赋能于每个人的个人超级智能。我们拥有构建所需大规模基础设施的资源和专业知识，也有能力和意愿通过我们的产品将新技术带给数十亿人。我很高兴能将 Meta 的精力集中在构建这个未来上。
